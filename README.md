This repository solves most of the exercises in "The Go Programming Language" book during my study.(The link to this book on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440)

This is an excellent book for any beginner of Go programming language.
